Automated Panel Solar Unit (A.P.S.U.)

This project is my capstone project of 2021 for my studies at Austin Peay State University.

I completed this project with 2 others being Nathan LaMotte and Nick Calin.

The goal was to create sun tracking solar panel using off the shelf components.

The secondary goal was to power a sign long enough to last an entire night.

I had a blast tackling this project and wish I had more time to refine it.
